# Reason for contributing on the mojoglobal project

Rising temperatures are affecting our climate and as a result, it affects our environment and the functions it delivers.
One such key function is nutrient replenishment. Climate change puts nutrient cycles at risk, which has a knock-on effect on soil fertility.
The impacts of climate change on different sectors of society are interrelated. Drought can harm food production and human health. 
Flooding can lead to disease spread and damages to ecosystems and infrastructure. Human health issues can increase mortality, impact food availability and limit worker productivity. Climate change impacts are seen throughout every aspect of the world we live in. 
However,climate change impacts are uneven across the country and the world â€” even within a single community, 
climate change impacts can differ between neighborhoods or individuals. 
Long-standing socioeconomic inequities can make  underserved groups,who often have the highest exposure to hazards and the fewest resources to respond,
are more vulnerable. 
Climate change reflects the variations in the average daily weather conditions such as temperature, humidity, rainfall and sunshine of a location over an extended period. Climate change in Nigeria threatens economic growth in sectors dependent on climatic conditions.Economic sectors such as agriculture,  fishery and forestry are more predisposed to the adverse effects of climate change. 
The Nigerian climate has been irregular over the years, alternating between periods of extreme dry or rainy seasons.Climate change in Nigeria has led to seasons 
of drought and excess flood, which affected agricultural activities and caused a loss of shelter. 
In 2019, the National Emergency Management Agency revealed floods had displaced approximately 1.9 million Nigerians.
